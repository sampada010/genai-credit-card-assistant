# OneCard Knowledge Base

## Card Delivery
Your OneCard is delivered within 5–7 business days after approval. You can track delivery inside the OneCard App → Cards → Track Delivery. If the courier is unable to reach you, a re-delivery attempt is made in 48 hours. Delays beyond 10 days should be reported to support. Virtual card is available immediately in the app after approval.

## Account & Onboarding
To apply for a OneCard, complete the application in the OneCard App and submit KYC (PAN, Aadhaar or video KYC). Approval decisions are usually available within 48 hours. If KYC verification fails, you'll receive an email with next steps. You can update personal details in Profile → Edit.

## Transaction & EMI
Transactions post to your account immediately but merchant settlements vary. EMI conversion can be requested for eligible transactions within 30 days of the purchase. EMI options commonly offered: 3, 6, 9, 12 months; tenor and interest may vary by merchant and promotion. Converting to EMI requires minimum eligible amount (e.g., ₹2,000). Fees and interest rates are shown during conversion.

## Bill & Statement
Statements are generated monthly. Your billing cycle and statement date are visible in the app under Bills → Statement. Minimum due is displayed on the statement. If you pay before the due date, the payment will reflect within 24 hours (bank processing times may vary). For disputed transactions, raise a chargeback within 30 days.

## Repayments
Payments may take 24 hours to reflect. You can pay via UPI, netbanking, debit card, or auto-debit. If you set up auto-pay, funds will be debited on the due date. If payment fails, we will notify you by email and in-app. For partial payments, interest may still accrue on remaining balances.

## Collections (Overdue)
If your account becomes overdue, you will receive reminders in-app, by email, and SMS. Late fees apply for missed payments — typical late fee structure: fixed fee (e.g., ₹100) + interest on overdue amount. For long overdue accounts, a collections process may be initiated; please contact support to discuss payment plans.

## Security & Blocking Card
If your card is lost or stolen, immediately block the card from the app (Cards → Block) or call customer support. Blocking prevents new transactions. A replacement physical card can be ordered in the app; it usually takes 5–7 business days for delivery.

## Fees & Charges
Standard late fee: ₹100 + taxes (typical; refer to your card agreement for exact amounts). Interest on unpaid balances is charged monthly at the product APR. Overseas transactions may carry an additional forex markup.

## Support & Escalation
If an issue is unresolved in-app, contact support via Help → Contact. For urgent card-related issues (lost card, suspicious activity), use the emergency phone number available in the app.
